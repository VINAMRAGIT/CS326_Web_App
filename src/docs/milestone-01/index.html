      <h3>Victor Chen</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Victor Chen and I am a sophomore at UMass studying CS and
        Math. I enjoy learning about machine learning and hope to explore its
        applications to fields like biology. Computational methods provide
        crucial insights in tackling problems in biology and improving our
        collective understanding of diseases and life. I also have experience
        with education and enjoy helping people learn while motivating them to
        pursue their interests.
      </p>
      <h3>Manu Hegde</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Manu Hegde and I am a sophomore CS student at UMass
        Amherst. My particular interests lie in web development, machine
        learning, and cybersecurity. My passion for CS focuses on its
        intersection with other industries, as I believe this is where the
        power of CS and its leverage can be seen. I have past experience
        working in Fintech (Fidelity Investments), education (Kara Tutoring),
        and national defense (MITRE), and am looking forward to gaining more
        experience in software engineering through future experiences.
      </p>
      <h3>Vinamra Tyagi</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Vinamra Tyagi, and I go by Vin. I am a sophomore CS UMass
        student, thoroughly involved in developing and refining software since
        2018. I have interests in ML/RL, and full-stack SWE. I have developed
        a passion for developing functional programs that benefit not only
        myself, but the world as a whole. I believe in the potential that CS
        has for improving our planet, and would love to use my skills as a
        developer to bring about that change!
      </p>
      <h3>Aarav Nair</h3>
      <p>
        I am a sophomore CS and math student. Much of my experience is in
        mobile app development, but I am also interested in web development
        and machine learning. I also enjoy learning about the intersection
        between CS and the social sciences, and how we can use computers to
        better understand data.
