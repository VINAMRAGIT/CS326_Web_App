    <section id="overview">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This project focuses on raising awareness for climate change, and specifically using visual
        displays of real-world data to provide a tangible representation of the current state of the
        environment, so that it is more digestible for the average consumer. Furthermore, we want to
        provide interactive methods with this data so that users can truly understand the underlying
        factors and systems that contribute to climate change, allowing them to understand the
        urgency of climate change. Featuring an interactive map, detailed profiles of important facets
        of climate change and its underlying system, and a modern way of engaging with this content,
        we hope to shed light on what users can do to make an impact. The target audience is particularly
        people who are interested in learning more about climate change but don’t feel entirely confident
        of their knowledge, so they are showing an interest in this issue; our application will operate
        as a user-friendly platform that provides this knowledge in an easy-to-understand way. Ideally,
        we will have multiple sections that tackle different aspects of climate change, such as visualizing
        the current situation, detailing actions that can be taken by users, and showcasing the impact of
        key variables when it comes to overall impact on the planet. If this application is able to actively
        engage discussion regarding climate change and invoke this conversation, then we have succeeded
        with our project's vision. </p>

    <section id="application-parts">
      <h2>Application Parts</h2>
      <p>There are three main components of this application, that all interact with each other to be able
        to present climate change in an easy-to-view format that serves to inform, educate, and inspire.
        First and foremost, we have the implementation of the underlying data structure itself, as well as
        its visualization. Through the use of basic fetch, we procure data from API's that pertain to the
        aspects of climate change that we will depict in the application, and through the use of clever CSS
        and JS interactivity, we will visualize the data in multiple formats, such as a map visualization
        and a more organized and traditional graph visualization.
        Beyond the simple visualization, our second component will include procuring the user's location
        (with their permission) and being able to provide suggestions regarding aspects of climate change
        that may impact them in the future. Additionally, we can also point the user towards organizations
        that work towards mitigating climate change or reversing its effects on the environment. This
        allows the user to be aware of any possible dangers from climate change that they may be facing,
        adding an intimate and personal aspect to this component of the application.
        Finally, we have an explanation of the underlying causes of the aspect of climate change being
        viewed in the visualization. This allows users to be aware of human actions, scientific processes,
        legislation, and other factors that may affect the aspect of climate change that they are currently
        viewing. It helps build a comprehensive understanding of how serious this issue is.</p>

      <h2>Wire Frames</h2>
      <div class="wireframe-picture" id="map-picture">
        <img src="images/Map.png">
      </div>
      <p>
        This is the “main” view and is highlighted by a map of the word. 
        The map is colored based on a category chosen by the user. 
        Potential examples are carbon emissions, average temperature, and average rainfall. 
        The category can be changed by clicking on the legend at the top of the page. 
        When the user hovers over the map, they can see more information. 
        For example, hovering over the US when the category is carbon emissions could show the specific amount as well as the largest sources of carbon. 
        The goal of this map is to show users the facts without being overwhelming. 
        A colorful map is a lot easier to look at than a list of facts.
      </p>
      <div class="wireframe-picture" id="slider-picture">
        <img src="images/Sliders.png">
      </div>
      <p>
        Underneath the map is a box with a variety of sliders. 
        Each slider reflects a carbon producing human activity, and by default each slider is set to 0. 
        Moving the sliders around will change the map view to show how these changes will affect the climate. 
        For example if the map is set to average rainfall, and the deforestation slider is set to -50%, 
        the map on the top will change to show average rainfall in a world where deforestation decreases by 50%. 
        The purpose of this view is to show the user that human activity affects climate change, 
        and that it is not out of our control.
      </p>
      <div class="wireframe-picture" id="uview-picture">
        <img src="images/UView.png">
      </div>
      <p>
        The “U-View” asks for the user’s location. It then uses this location to give them specific information about that area. 
        Examples include current and projected meteorological data, as well as possible local initiatives to combat climate change. 
        The purpose of this page is to help users understand how climate change affects them. 
        It can be easy to avoid the topic if you believe only those living in specific areas will be affected. 
        We want to show them that everyone will be affected.
      </p>
      <div class="wireframe-picture" id="resource-picture">
        <img src="images/Resources.png">
      </div>
      <p>
        This view shows the user a variety of other resources to learn more about climate change and how to combat it. 
        There are images with the logos of various organizations, and each image is a link to that organization. 
        The purpose of this page is to keep the user engaged with the topic of climate change after they have visited our website.

    <section id="real-world">
      <h2>Real World Connection</h2>
      <p>Our application is meant to serve as an educational platform for all those interested in learning
        more about climate change, as our central goal is to raise awareness of this issue and foster a sense
        of community and action. For many, their inaction towards climate change simply comes from a lack of
        knowledge and understanding, and oftentimes these same individuals do want to learn about climate
        change. Furthermore, this is one of the few issues where individuals' impacts truly matter, as if
        enough people band together with a common goal, a significant amount of change can occur as we work
        towards solving this issue one day at a time. Our goal is to complement this process, providing an
        application that serves as a centerpiece for all the information that someone can learn about this
        issue and get involved in this advocacy at a local and national level.
        Of course, many factors impact climate change and have led to the current state of the world we live
        in today. One of the biggest factors is the release of greenhouse gasses, such as carbon dioxide and
        methane. Much confusion surrounds the severity of this problem; not only do many believe that this
        isn't an important issue, but they also see it as a far-removed issue that they can have no impact on.
        However, it is the complete opposite on both accounts. Not only are greenhouse gasses one of the most
        important issues in the world today, involving not just the environment, but the progress of our world's
        energy avenues and economic development, but it is something that individuals can have an impact on
        through their direct actions. This is what we hope our application will achieve; inspiring users to
        care about climate change and use their leverage and impact to make a difference.
        In order to communicate this information, we understand the importance of how this information is
        presented. First, the view of the central map will serve as the main example of visualization for
        the user, showcasing data to the user to allow them to understand the current state of the situation.
        By interacting with this display, the user can enrich their understanding and understand the severity
        and importance of the issue, thereby realizing why this platform was developed in the first place.
        From here, our display of the system of climate change will shed insight into the true inner workings
        of the entire situation, further allowing users to understand the factors that contribute to this
        problem and the actions that need to be taken in order to alleviate this. Potentially, this could
        involve a type of simulation, allowing users to experiment with these factors to specifically see
        their impact on the situation. Finally, the communal aspect is key for truly being able to create
        change; awareness is simply the first step in this journey and will be moot if it isn't applied to
        the real world. By allowing our users to band together and be able to find local connections to
        continue taking action regarding this issue, will allow these thoughts to manifest into concrete
        steps of impact. By providing key information, the user is now informed and equipped with the knowledge
        they need to make change in the world. With the power of the community, our product highlights the
        symbiotic relationship between advocacy and collaboration in achieving true change.
        Ultimately, our product aims to connect individuals to the idea of climate change and promote the
        steps to action to address this issue. We want to tackle multiple aspects of the real-world
        connection, providing not just the contextual understanding but also the catalyst for the conversation
        and the resources to spark this change. Climate change won't be solved simply through forced means;
        it requires the collective effort of everyone, which can only be made possible by fostering a communal
        understanding of our role in the world today. Our product is a symbol of the power of computer science,
        leveraging our skills to raise awareness and create change in the world. Furthermore, in an ideal
        situation, our product would be successful if it eventually was not used anymore; by providing this
        awareness and call for action, our hope is for this to inspire others to continuously advocate for
        these efforts, resulting in a reinforcing loop that only grows as more get involved. It is this result
        that will truly show whether our vision was achieved, and showcases the path that we want to go down
        in order to allow our application to reach its fullest potential. </p>

    <section id="integrative-experience">
      <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
      <p>Developing this application embodies the essence of an integrative experience, requiring us to leverage the skills we
      have gained from prior courses and experiences to design an effective web application. For instance, in CS220 we learned
      how to fetch from APIs, and in this project we will be using a variety of APIs to provide us with climate data. We are
      also taking advantage of the data structures we learned in CS187 and the general programming knowledge we gained across
      all our programming courses. All of us have web development before ever entering college, making the transition from
      traditional software development to web-based full stack application easy for us individually and as a group.
      
      In addition, our experiences relating to environmental science are also essential to the creation of this application.
      Through knowledge we gained from introductory environmental science and biology courses, we understand the general
      factors that negatively influence the global climate and the various metrics used to measure climate change.
      
      Being able to merge our academic skill sets with our personal experiences is one of the most enthralling aspects of this
      project. Despite the challenges, we see the potential with developing in a team-based setting where our combined
      experiences will enable us to develop an exceptional application.
