# CS326_Web_App

## Structure
In the `src/client` folder is all our code. Index.html holds all the code for our main page and application. Index.js holds the functionality for many of the components in our application, while styles.css holds the main styling for our page. db.js is our implementation of PouchDB for the application. We have a `src/images` folder that holds all the images that are used on the webpage. We then have a `src/data` folder that holds all the mock data that we are using for this display.

## Setup
To start our project, you will simply need to run `npm i` in order to install all the necessary packages. From there, simply running `npm run milestone-02` will start the application and allow you to review what we have built.

## Navigate
Simply use the navigation bar at the top of the page to traverse through our application. There are three distinct sections: the map, simulation, and resources page. Interacting with these pages individually will display all the angles from which we are tackling the issue of climate change. Our main objective was to make our page accessible when informing users about this issue, which is what we attempted to do with each of these wireframes.
